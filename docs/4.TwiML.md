//4 TwiML
=========

TwiML is an XML definition of what you want to have happen during your call. You can have a call play an audio file, read text in a cool robot voice, collect dial tone/voice input and more. TwiML can point to more TwiML allowing to make dynamic and complex calls. Traditionally a web app would generate TwiML based on a URL.

### Example TwiML

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
    <Say voice="woman">Please leave a message after the tone.</Say>
</Response>
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
    <Play>some/audio/file/url/here.mp3</Play>
</Response>
```

We are not going to write a web app, so we cant host our own TwiML. Twimlets, a project from Twilio, allows you to easily generate TwiML and have it hosted for you. All you need to do is point your API call at the generated TwiML.
