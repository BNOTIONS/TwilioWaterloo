//1 What is Twilio?
===================

Twilio is an API for interacting with phone systems. Twilio allows you to make/receive phone calls and send/receive SMS messages. Beyond that Twilio allows you to easily capture and save voice messages, programmatically route calls and has SDKs for most popular programming languages.

Twilio has a lot of utility considering much of the world still runs on phone calls. Want to make a simple menu based switcher? Easy. Send your customers SMS alerts and reminders? Simple. Prank call your friends and record their reaction? Win.
